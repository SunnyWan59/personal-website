            <p>Hello! My name is Sunny and I am currently studying mathematics at the University of Toronto.
                I hope to learn more about how techology, sepcifically artifical intelligence, changes how we 
                approach problems in the future. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although I currently live in Toronto, I am originally from the Boston area, spending most of my 
                childhood there, and some of my fondest memories were hiking along various mountains and trails
                in New England. Nowadays though, I spend my time reading, working of personal projects and exploring all 
                that Toronto has to offer. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I encourage anyone to contact me if they are interested in talking!
